Now we're ready to implement progressive alien firing without fear of losing this stable version. If anything goes wrong, you can always:
git reset --hard f9d91d7 (reset to this commit)
git checkout v1.0-mobile-optimized (if you create the tag)
Would you like me to:
Create a tagged version for extra safety?

Current Difficulty Progression Analysis
What's Already Scaling:
Enemy Fire Rate: Decreases from 5000ms to 1000ms (faster firing) - Line 354
Enemy Speed: Increases by +0.3 per wave - Line 353
Boss Attack Speed: Gets faster with each boss wave (-10% per boss wave)
Boss Projectile Speed: +0.5 speed per boss wave
Boss Teleport Frequency: More frequent at higher waves
What's NOT Scaling Enough:
Number of simultaneous alien shots (currently random single shooter)
Variety in attack patterns from regular aliens
No "burst fire" mechanics from aliens
No coordinated alien attacks
Recommendations to Make it More Addictive:
1. Progressive Alien Firing (Your Suggestion) ✓ EXCELLENT
Waves 1-5: Single random alien shoots
Waves 6-10: 2 aliens shoot simultaneously
Waves 11-15: 3 aliens + occasional "burst fire" (2-3 rapid shots)
Waves 16+: 4+ aliens + coordinated column attacks
2. Visual/Audio Feedback Improvements
Add combo counter when destroying multiple aliens quickly
Score multipliers for combos (2x, 3x, 5x, 10x)
Screen flash effects on big combos
Sound effects for different actions (if not already present)
3. Risk/Reward Mechanics
Danger zones: Aliens in bottom rows worth 2x points (high risk = high reward)
Perfect wave bonus: Clear wave without taking damage = bonus points
Speed kill bonus: Clear wave quickly = time bonus points
4. Progressive Enemy Behavior
Wave 10+: Some aliens do "dive bombs" toward player
Wave 15+: Formation changes mid-wave (creates unpredictability)
Wave 20+: "Elite" aliens that take 2-3 hits to destroy
5. Power-Up Strategy Layer
Make power-ups spawn predictably after X kills (not random 30%)
Add power-up preview indicator (shows next power-up type)
Add negative power-ups at higher waves (reverses controls for 3 seconds, etc.)
6. Progression Hooks (Addictiveness)
Daily challenges: "Survive 3 waves without shield"
Achievement system: "Destroy 100 aliens", "Reach wave 20", etc.
Leaderboard (local storage): Top 10 high scores
Unlock cosmetics: New ship colors/skins at milestones
7. Difficulty Curve Balancing
Grace period: Waves 1-3 stay easy (let players learn)
Steep ramp: Waves 4-10 increase difficulty faster
Plateau: Waves 11-15 stabilize (let players master mechanics)
Endgame chaos: Wave 16+ becomes bullet hell
Would you like me to implement:
Progressive alien firing (multiple simultaneous shooters + burst fire)?
Combo system with score multipliers?
Any of the other mechanics above?


Immediate Priority - Polish & Testing
Test Current Features
Test wave transition timing (is 2 seconds good or too long/short?)
Test boss position in mobile portrait (180px - is it visible enough?)
Test pause button accessibility on all devices
Test combo system visibility and timing
Verify difficulty curve feels balanced at waves 10-20
Fine-tune Gameplay Feel
Adjust wave transition duration if needed
Tweak combo timeout (currently 3 seconds)
Balance boss difficulty across waves 5, 10, 15, 20+
